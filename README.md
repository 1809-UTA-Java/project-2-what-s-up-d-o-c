Working in teams of 5, upload your Mule-Maven project to your repo on 1807-UTA-Java with one or more flows connecting at least:
- 5 Spring Boot microservices (one for each)
- A custom flow connecting them (more complex than a simple circle)
- Other connections like:
    - File logs
    - Online Third Party APIs
    - Direct JDBC database connections
    - Messaging Queues (ActiveMQ, etc)
